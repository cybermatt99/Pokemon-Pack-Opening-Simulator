# Pokemon-Pack-Opening-Simulator
Using PyGame I created a Pokemon Pack Opening Simulator with a really clean GUI.

First things first, there are a LOT of zip files here (to make uploading easier).
Download and unzip all of these files into one directory.
If you have Python 3 and PyGame installed, you should be able to double-click the mainGH.py
file and start running the program.

If that doesn't work for you, navigate to your command line, and cd to the directory
in which you downloaded everything.

Then run 'python mainGH.py' and that should do the trick!

BY THE WAY
If the background noise seems kinda weird and wonky, that's probably due to the
fact that I had to compress it just to get it to upload to GitHub (still
trying to figure that out). In the meantime, here is a link to the true
audio file on Google Drive - add this to your /sounds folder and you're all set!

The reason there is a mainGH.py file and a main.py file is because somewhere
along the way, whether through my compression methods or the upload/download
to Github the file folders that store all of the assets have been doubled up.
So 'sounds/soundtrack.mp3' has become 'sounds/sounds/soundtrack.mp3'. Until
I can figure out a solution to this just use the mainGH.py file and it should
work fine.
