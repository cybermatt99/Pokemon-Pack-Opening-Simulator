# Pokemon-Pack-Opening-Simulator
Using PyGame I created a Pokemon Pack Opening Simulator with a really clean GUI.

First things first, there are a LOT of zip files here (to make uploading easier).
Download and unzip all of these files into one directory.
BE CAREFUL WHEN DOING THIS!!!
If you use 7zip make sure you select 'Extract Here' instead of 'Extract Files'.
Otherwise it will create an extra file folder of the same name and you will have
to redo the file extraction. This will cause the program not to work so be careful!

If you have Python 3 and PyGame installed, you should be able to double-click the main.py
file and start running the program.

If you do not have Python and Pygame installed, follow the instructions 
here: https://www.python.org/
and here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted and you should be good to go in no time!
They are useful programs to have either way.

If the double clicking doesn't seem to work for you, navigate to your command line, and cd to the directory
in which you downloaded everything.

Then run 'python main.py' and that should do the trick! Send me a message if there are any errors
that show and I will do my best to help.

BY THE WAY
If something goes wrong with the background noise or it sounds weird or wonky,
that may be an effect of the file compression. If that happens, here is the link to 
the full song:

Plus you might just be interested in it because its so darn catchy!
This is the theme from the Pokemon Trading Card Game from the Game Boy Advance
all the way back in the year 2000. What a nostalgic track! I thought it would be nice
to honor that legendary game here by borrowing its soundtrack. I'm sure it won't mind.
